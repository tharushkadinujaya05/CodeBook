You're planning a weekend getaway with your friends and need to calculate the
total expenses, including costs for accommodation, transportation, and
activities. You've decided to go on a road trip with 4 friends. The cost per person
for accommodation is $50 per night, transportation costs $200 for the entire
trip, and you've budgeted $100 for activities for all.
Write a JavaScript code to calculate the total expenses of the weekend getaway
and display the result.
(use “let” or “var” to define variables and alert box )
