<!--
Scenario: You're organizing a party and need to calculate the total
cost, including expenses for food, decorations, and entertainment.
Suppose you're hosting a party for 30 guests. The cost per person for
food is $15, decorations cost $150, and entertainment (such as a DJ
or live band) costs $300.
Write a JavaScript code to calculate the total cost of the party and
display the result.
(use “let” or “var” to define variables)
